# Little Logistics Mod for Minecraft Forge

### Download

Not ready for regular use.
See "Releases" page for experimental builds.

### Features

Water logistics: Tugs and barges. 

Tugs need fuel and a "Tug Route" item (see item description for usage instructions). 
Vessels can be linked with a "vessel chain". 

Tug will stop when next to a "Tug Dock", please make a straight canal at least as long as your tug-train for the dock, and place a barge dock for each barge in the train next to the tug dock. Tug Dock can be flipped by shift right clicking, make sure the top aligns with the direction of the barge docks. Barge docks can be set to extract mode by shift right clicking. To insert into tugs/barges, place a hopper on top of a dock, to extract from a barge place a hopper under corresponding water block next to the barge dock.
